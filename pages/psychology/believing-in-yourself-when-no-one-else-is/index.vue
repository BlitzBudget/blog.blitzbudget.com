                                sufficient to push to significantly forward in
                                life provided that your goal is something constructive and noble (for a lack of a better
                                term).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes even though your goals are noble and high you might have been born in the most
                                underprivileged community in the world. But if you are reading this then trust me you
                                are not. It is those in North Korea and those without electricity that are the most
                                underprivileged in the world right now.
                                <br>

                                You can change your belief system and truly believe in your ability to make it life man.
                                I hear so many stories where the father who was born poor has made it to a middle-class
                                family and their children have finally become truly wealthy that they can buy a jet-like
                                Grant Cardone. Although the has around 500 million dollars in debt he says he is truly
                                wealthy. I don’t know man but still.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                People live a much better life than they thought they could. That could at least be
                                taken as the moral of the story if not for anything else.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Being born less privileged is not your fault as long as you are in a capitalistic system
                                and not a tyranny you have a chance of ensuring that you can push yourself a little bit
                                higher on the financial ladder.
                                <br>

                                You deserve and I truly believe that I deserve it. This is exactly why I am doing
                                whatever it is that I am doing. Working crazy hours, practically every waking hour doing
                                something that is going to directly benefit the quality of my life. Rather than
                                binge-watching Netflix during weekends.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I either talk with my family, spend time with my wife or work on BlitzBudget or learn
                                about programming. It could be too much at times for me because I always think I have
                                too many ideas but my execution time is so less efficient that I had to put in a lot of
                                hours now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                People say I have to put in 10,000 hours into something to be truly better at something,
                                I think I have already put in 10,000 hours into programming, but I still feel like I
                                have only barely scratched the surface of it and once you get so good at it you will
                                find out that you need to learn more Spanish and communication skills that are impeding
                                you from progress in your job.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Or it is something as silly as your age. Yes, people think I am too young to be an
                                architect. Maybe they are right man! But that does not stop me from not trying to be
                                one. It has been my dream to become a software architect. Now that I am in a different
                                country that barely speaks English and even programs in Spanish I had to learn Spanish
                                and be better at communication than Spanish.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You would have to be better than the average population to be worthy of a high-paying
                                job. So, here I am trying to do exactly that, I hope I learn more Spanish and get that
                                out of the way only then would I know what else is impeding the progress.
                                <br>

                                Life can feel like it is so hard but if our will is strong that we do not see the
                                obstacles as obstacles but as an opportunity to get a little bit stronger than we were.
                                I think we are good.
                                <br>

                                Just went to Rome for a trip last week and saw the colosseum for the first time, man! It
                                is truly wonderful and authentically humbling. Do you know what else is? That I was not
                                born in the Roman era as a slave fighting in the colosseum.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Truly horrifying! Those people saw each other fight to the death for the entertainment
                                of the crowd!! Could probably be the first horror movie experience on such a large
                                scale. It was so big that it could seat thousands of people. Much larger than Santiago
                                Bernabéu stadium in Madrid it was 525 meters wide.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is said that the biggest festivals involved 12,000 humans and 11,000 animals
                                slaughtered in a span of 120 days for entertainment. What humans do to humans is just
                                amazing!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So the point being! I am so happy to be born under a capitalistic democracy to have a
                                voice and be privileged to such a large amount of audience with the use of the internet
                                for such a low investment capital.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I just use a Free version of Evernote, a Free version of Grammarly and Probably Amazon,
                                Later on, to make this into a book to be sold. What a privilege!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Maybe no one reads it! Maybe it is the least-read book in the entire world but honestly
                                who cares? How would I learn if I don’t try? How can I let myself be defeated by the
                                fear of failure or a need for perfection??
