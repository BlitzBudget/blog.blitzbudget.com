                                harm might be seen as being incapable of doing it.
                                And certain people are definitely incapable of doing it. Have you seen that bullies
                                target the smallest and weakest among us? it is because despite being small they choose
                                not to retaliate. That weakness in ourselves and the want to be good to other people is
                                what is seen and can eventually be used to take away something that you hold precious
                                from those who can do it.

                                If you lose something without anyone stealing anything from you then it is because you
                                didn't deserve it. If you had something stolen and you deserved it, You will either find
                                a way to get it back or you will be capable of earning more than what you had lost in
                                the first place.

                                It is absolutely impossible to deserve something without integrating the yin and yang
                                into ourselves. The good and the evil. The angel and the demon. We have the capability
                                to inflict harm and to create. It is the self-consciousness of being vulnerable and
                                thereby susceptible to being damaged that also gives us the know-how to inflict the same
                                misfortune on others.

                                That is exactly why more than 90% of the lottery winners lose what they had earned in
                                less than 5 years. They had not developed the tenacity that is required to preserve what
                                they had earned. Being lucky once does not guarantee that you will be able to withhold
                                that fortune long enough to reap the benefits. The person who worked hard and earned it
                                had had to make a lot of mistakes on the way to riches and those lessons are there to
                                stay.

                                Even though Bill gates look like being incapable of harming someone and looks like an
                                introvert. They say he cheated on his wife. Whether we are conscious of our evil self or
                                not it has the potential to take over us and makes us do the things that we could one
                                day regret. Short Term benefits do not justify the sacrifice of long-term returns. It
                                may seem tempting but definitely not worth it.

                                The seductive types are precisely those who want something out of you for providing
                                short-term benefits. Could be a marketing gimmick that convinces us that they are the
                                best person there is to do that job but turn out to be a complete and utter disaster at
                                what they do. They seduced us with their marketing skills but the reality was far worse
                                than what they had promised to provide.

                                When we are harmless or seem harmless the one advantage is that we look extremely
                                friendly and approachable. People love and are attracted to the good subconsciously and
                                stay away from a rude-looking face of the possibility of the danger that it represents.
                                People fall in love with honesty and genuineness. It provides a place where people feel
                                like they actually understand. I do believe that lying makes people go in the opposite
                                direction of feeling attracted. They move away from you and feel distanced as if not
                                knowing you. It is because people hate lying or being lied to.

                                The harmless person is also the person that is susceptible to lies and deception. It is
                                usually the weaker person that has the necessity to go undercover and not face the real
                                danger head-on courageously. They know that would die for sure. The same reason children
                                lie and bite. And the same reason children cry. Due to the helplessness.

                                We feel extremely helpless when we are benign and incapable of inflicting harm. People
                                fear crossing the line when you are a monster or when are integrated. Better to portray
                                yourself as a harmless approachable person in front of society and assume it is good in
                                people and the good comes out when we are good and portray ourselves as good.

                                Failing to see the truth right in front of us and refusing to believe what is hard to
                                digest but true is the hallmark of ignorance and harmlessness and the fear that dictates
                                our behaviour. Choosing to always see the truth despite the signs of deception and masks
                                that people wear will ensure that we are less susceptible to deception and more inclined
                                toward achieving what we want to achieve.

                                The tenacity required to achieve what we want to achieve comes from the strength of the
                                personality which can only be obtained by integrating our evil into our soul and aiming
                                toward the good despite the suffering of it all. Now we are entering the domain of
                                religion, Faith. The very first step in achieving what you want is seeing yourself
                                already there before even starting the journey.

                                It requires a certain level of courage to reach a point in life where we choose to be
                                audacious with our goals and dreams. It also requires naivety and charm along with the
                                willpower and strength to face whatever is thrown at us. Every time reach a goal, it
                                gives us the confidence that we can achieve what we aimed at and makes us a little more
                                confident to aim even higher. It is precisely the reason why confident people can aim
                                high and the person without confidence is the one that cannot aim high and is satisfied
                                with an aimless life.
