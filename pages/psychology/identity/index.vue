                                afford to screw up in life. And screwing up
                                would mean we lose the only possible way to redeem ourselves and that would essentially
                                mean that we had lost a precious 5-year or 10-year period during which we could have
                                really improved ourselves and worked to take a couple of steps up the ladder of
                                hierarchy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some people might think, Nah! Thatâ€™s not me! I am privileged. To them I say truly are
                                you the one percent or the top 20 percent who can really afford to live a life without
                                stressing too much about perfection or at least not making a mistake in the first place.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Most of the people at the bottom end of the hierarchy are the ones who can neither
                                afford to make a mistake nor are willing to stop making them. And education is probably
                                the only way out for them. But educating ourselves that the north is south and the south
                                is north will only do more harm than good. You will know in your core that it is wrong
                                because no matter what you do the world would seem to resist you and prevent you from
                                propagating towards your goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Take it to the extreme then any action aligned towards the dark or the opposite would
                                make you lose everything you ever had and are ever going to have. Including your future
                                potential. For example, dying or going to prison among others.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What is the true meaning of education then? Trying to understand that as a human we are
                                not capable of making our lives better all by ourselves. We need people around us,
                                mentors, and loved ones, even in the form of movies, vlogs and books. That you can get
                                inspired by and start moving towards your goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That then implicitly means that you have to align towards the highest possible good in
                                Jordan Peterson's words. Then focus on learning how to get there from where you are and
                                along the way we meet different sets of people. Some are completely aligned with your
                                thoughts and feeling. Someone with whom you could really connect and get things going
                                without any friction.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And there are others, the vast majority of the people with whom we may not be as
                                connected due to innate differences and circumstances, language barriers and a plethora
                                of other things that could differentiate one human being and another. It is with those
                                that we first start slowly mingling under a common circumstance, try to understand that
                                difference a little more and truly understand where it is that they are coming from.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And it is through those differences that we often find out most of the time that what
                                they are doing makes more sense than what we have been doing and then we start learning
                                and imitating them. To try and understand what we get as a result of this new behaviour.
                                As a result, we become better people.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It could even be from a movie. All of these require tolerance of the differences and
                                above all true empathy and understanding from which the other person comes from. In that
                                sense, tolerance is letting things slide but you are not truly convinced that what they
                                are doing is right. But if you truly are convinced that you are right and if the other
                                person means so much to you. And they should matter much more than your necessity to
                                project yourself as a NICE person. Then you guys could have a true discussion from which
                                Maybe a new understanding can arise.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That sense of open-mindedness is very hard to derive without knowledge and wisdom. True
                                wisdom comes from exploring different sets of behaviours and understanding where you
                                could potentially arrive if you had incorporated them into yourself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That would truly mean that you could become whoever you chose to be without feeling like
                                an imposter. You only feel like an imposter if the new knowledge has not truly convinced
                                you yet. If you start feeling like that then start to see examples of why not to
                                incorporate this new behaviour into yourself and understand the true counter-arguments
                                that arise out of that conversation thereby factoring in the pros and cons of that new
                                knowledge.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Like it or not, everything starts with action, it could be a subconscious impulse or
                                thought. Then that repetitive thought becomes a habit, then the habit becomes behaviour
                                and behaviour becomes an identity. You are a person who does this or that. If it has
                                reached that far into yourself then it might be really hard to isolate yourself from
                                being that person, it might feel completely foreign to you. But trust me that feeling
                                will come to pass and you will start to feel normal again after a while.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But that too requires awareness of the new behaviour and continuous learning and
                                adapting. It might seem like a lot of work but like it or not we are already doing it
                                implicitly or subconsciously all the time! You might as well be cognizant of that fact.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That new behaviour would have consequences, and those consequences might be that you
                                will start losing old friends who no longer think you are what they thought you were.
                                You might start living a better life. That would mean that you would have to destroy the
                                destructive habits. And understand the underlying impulse driving you towards that
                                destructive behaviour.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The whole aura behind the destructive behaviour is that they are enticing to do right
                                now but repeat them 1000 times then they would take you to a very dark place out of
                                which not even god can take you before you destroy yourself in it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Truly understand that your identity is your iterations of repeated actions due to a
                                subconscious impulse.
