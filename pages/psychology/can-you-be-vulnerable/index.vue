                            <p> but requires an elaborated answer. Some people strongly think
                                that vulnerability is a weakness and do not show it. Strength is something that ought to
                                be
                                shown but vulnerabilities should be hidden.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the wrong people were to find out your vulnerabilities they can exploit them and use
                                that
                                vulnerability against you. The above state is simply true. I would want to show my
                                strengths
                                to a stranger and try to hide my vulnerabilities. It is dangerous to show it all the
                                time.
                                People can misunderstand it as a weakness. But the mere act of being charming is in and
                                of
                                itself vulnerable. You open yourself up in front of others and are welcoming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Vulnerability is extremely powerful when used appropriately. I would just say hide your
                                vulnerabilities with the stranger and just be vulnerable with everyone else. You only
                                have
                                more to gain. There is no possibility of connecting with anyone without being vulnerable
                                and
                                the possibility is forever closed if we close ourselves up just because we think someone
                                might see the deepest part of ourselves and judge us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We might be worried for a lot of reasons right. I hardly follow my advice. Here I am
                                opening
                                myself up in front of everyone writing something. I used to be worried about it all the
                                time. What if someone criticizes the way I think and see the deepest part of me and do
                                not
                                like that part. I might find myself feeling helpless because here I am opening up and I
                                do
                                not know anything about them. They might even show up at my home and take everything
                                away
                                from that which I hold dearest and possibly leave me on the streets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Living in a developed country has its benefits. I would even do the same thing back In
                                India. I think it is reasonable to say that even in India it is fairly safe if you have
                                hearts of steel. People sometimes are relentless and can be too harshly critical there.
                                I
                                think it is possible because of the competition and the population. It is truly a
                                zero-sum
                                game where people cannot afford to let someone simply grow and see and just be happy.
                                They
                                have to ensure that they sabotage it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can just feel it in your heart when you speak with people like that. You have an
                                intense
                                dislike and you would just feel uncomfortable sharing information with them. follow your
                                heart and do as your heart demands. Nowadays I am calmer about it as the fear of being
                                vulnerable is only an impediment to my creativity and prevents me from writing a book in
                                this case.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Jordan Peterson says that he has been heavily scrutinized and attacked in the
                                public
                                space for having an opinion. He is not joking and I think he is underplaying it and not
                                being honest with just how much backlash he is enduring. He is like a good manager
                                protecting us from shit and just giving us what we need. I can see it in his face
                                nowadays
                                the stress of it all. I know much of it is caused by his deteriorating health and all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, Here he was being vulnerable and posting information on social media and youtube.
                                and
                                He even dared to enter the political space to try and prevent the free speech of Canada
                                from
                                being taken away. The constitution now demands that a certain population be addressed
                                appropriately. It is demanded by the constitution. I don't know. I do not have
                                sufficient
                                knowledge about it to challenge such a huge debate. So let us stick with what we know.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I feel like every human being is just capable of writing down their experiences if they
                                choose to and sharing them with the entire world. If they dare choose to do it, They are
                                making themselves vulnerable just by doing it. Today it is simply impossible to not be
                                vulnerable when we are creating something even in a private space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is a request to be judged and the judge is the buyer or the consumer. When the
                                consumer
                                chooses you, you win else you lose. It would be better if they provide constructive
                                advice
                                along the way. A very less percentage of the population is inclined to leave a review.
                                It is
                                the ones that are mind blown by the product or the ones that are extremely disappointed
                                by
                                it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Honestly, there will be both, we just have to minimize the negative experience and try
                                and
                                provide a positive overall outcome without taking anything to heart. As I always say, I
                                am
                                usually the one who fails to take my advice at times. It is probably because I have not
                                yet
                                trained my mind to just do what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I had been trying to do that and If I try not to be vulnerable only say very little. In
                                the
                                end, I ended up with far fewer friends than I initially started with and could not make
                                any
                                new friends along the way. It was just extremely impossible. The mere possibility of
                                being
                                vulnerable just opens up a lot of doors which we would want to have open. God only knows
                                how
                                many opportunities I have lost as a direct result of having a closed heart and speaking
                                to
                                far fewer people than I should have in the initial phases of my work life in Spain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was probably the single best thing that I learned from these 2 years of learning
                                about
                                psychology. We need more people around us, We need to build a strong relationship with
                                ourselves to do it. Have a great amount of integrity and strength to be able to open up
                                and
                                be vulnerable. If we may be trying to do it consistently, good things might start
                                happening
                                to us. It is just maybe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What If I just do not open up myself and choose to stay closed then I know with a 100%
                                probability that the possibility of making new friends is near 0% and the loss of
                                opportunities as a direct result of losing such a relationship is boundless. As Jordan
                                Peterson said we are two people away from a million and three people away from a billion
                                possibilities. As one person has the most likely probability of meeting 1000 people in
                                their
                                life. But of course, it is abnormally high for the super-rich and abnormally low for the
                                super-poor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being poor just seems to have no advantage whatsoever. fewer people, less money, fewer
                                opportunities, fewer choices, high probability of death at an early age. And they are
                                probably the ones that are the most vulnerable and mostly they do not have any choice
                                but to
                                be vulnerable and helpless. And as a direct result of it, they are the ones paying the
                                most
                                price.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also know that around 500,000 accidents take place in India per year directly as a
                                result
                                of the lack of road rules. That would mean that in my meagre 20 years in India, there
                                would
                                have been more than 10 million people directly affected by the accidents ignoring other
                                types of the possible way people could just die. I found it very weird that I found no
                                one.
                                Back then I was also under the impression that such distribution of casualties is even.
                                But
                                The sad truth to that assumption is NO. It seems that the poor people among the
                                population
                                seem to be paying a much higher price than the middle class.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As someone said when the rich people catch a cold, poor people are dying in droves of
                                pneumonia.
