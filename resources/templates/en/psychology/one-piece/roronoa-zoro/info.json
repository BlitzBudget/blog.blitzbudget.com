Hawk-Eye gets disappointed in Zoro initially when he begs but understands that he is doing it for someone else so he agrees to train him. The irony in all of this is that Zoro wants to be trained by Hawk Eye for Zoro to be the world's best swordsman by killing Hawk Eye."

When Zoro realizes that there is a no-win situation and they are doomed to fail and Kuma is going to arrest Luffy. Zoro sacrifices himself instead of Luffy and strikes a bargain with Kuma. Sanji realizing all of this comes to Zoroâ€™s rescue and Zoro bashes Sanji unconscious and indeed successfully negotiated his sacrifice which leaves Zoro on the brink of death. The extent of the injury is evident when he needs to be taken care of by Negative Hollow after so many days and is required to recuperate for two weeks before starting to be trained by Hawk Eye."

What is the use of the world's best swordsman if he is constantly not putting himself in danger for the betterment of everyone around him and as an extension the whole world? And such a strong person should also be reliable, loyal, and strong and could see through the lies."
