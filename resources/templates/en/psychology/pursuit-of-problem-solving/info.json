I was so into it and also proud of it that in my 6th semester I was watching the lord of the rings series and studying for an exam. It was typical that we had 2 - 3 days of holidays before an exam. They were tough. Guess what! I failed and had to rewrite it the next semester to pass it. I never did that again! Ever!"

I know now that right now getting things off my mind is more important to facilitate me to focus on other things later on which might require its due attention. It just helps me focus and get the thoughts flowing. That way I guess that it would leave you with something more to take away from this blog than what you came with."

Isnâ€™t that problem-solving in some sense? They enter a hypothetical world in which a problem is posed in front of them with limitations and the harsher the limitations, the better the game. You train yourself more and more in this virtual world and become a gamer. It might as well be because the real world rejected them or that everything that you connect or can connect is online in that game."

That day they might realize and be shocked at what they have become by comparing themselves with other people who are in a much better position than they are."

Their focus needs to change a little, they might need to put in a little more work towards the new direction and start from where they are now. But overall there is satisfaction with what they have achieved like finishing a game and feeling accomplished. However, it is ever fleeing so we focus on other issues to resolve."
