When you miss important information with the full intention of keeping the other person in the dark and thus manipulating the situation, we are manipulating the truth a bit further, stretching the truth a little further and thus it snaps back at us with a higher intensity than the lie of commission because the lie of the commission includes false information in place instead of omitting it completely thus just twisting the truth to serve the person telling the lie, in other words stretching it comparatively a little less than the lie of omission."

That is why corruption is bad! That is why stealing is bad! That’s why those who steal also lie. And those who lie also tend to think that others lie to them. And as a matter of fact, choose to think that others lie to them because they are trying to manipulate them into getting something (forcibly taking something valuable from them forever) by manipulation."

And one fine day, the security team finds an unexpected VPN connection from China and digs deeper to find out that you have been outsourcing everything for the past 6 years, so they choose to dig deeper then find out that the degree certificate provided was forged! Moreover, it was the responsibility of the interviewer to find out if the hired person knew necessary before hiring them, so they find out that the interviewer is corrupt and might have been hiring people based on the bribe paid to him.
